# React Admin Demo + Java Spring Boot/JWT/MySQL REST Backend

This is a demo of the [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) library for React.js. It creates a working administration for a fake poster shop named Posters Galore. You can test it online at http://marmelab.com/react-admin-demo.

Backend based on the work of [zifnab87](https://github.com/zifnab87) on https://github.com/zifnab87/react-admin-demo-java-rest and https://github.com/Nooul/spring-boot-rest-api-helpers

Work In Progress: Adapt Auth and Data providers to make use of Spring Boot Backend.
